<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The goal of this repo is to demonstrate how an web application with PassportJS, using the local-strategy, can be made and used.
Authentication amongst web applications and websites is an important aspect of how users can attain access and use the many features an app or site have to offer. Typical methods of registering a user and asking them to login to the app or site is mandatory. The problem is that if an app is not setup properly the authentication process can be tedious and prone to security mishaps. PassportJS is a great framework to streamline the process of authenticating a user and ensuring that the user has a good user experience whilst using the app or site.

<p>
This repo provides and example in how to setup a NodeJS application wherein PassportJS can be added for authentication purposes. The repo also uses the MVC methodology and integrates PassportJS into the flow from user to server to database and back to the user.
