<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
The goal of this repo is to demonstrate how an web application with PassportJS, using the local-strategy, can be made and used.
</p>
<h2>Project and Scope</h2>
<p>
The project is a web application that uses authentication to allow users to register, log in and log out of the web application.
</p>
<p>
The scope starts from the user initializing use of the app through register and login. The scope ends with the user successfully registering and logging into the application then logging out. 
</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<p>
This repo can be used to learn how authentication works using a web application. The practical application would be to include this in a web application to allow authorized users access to the content you have made in your web application.
